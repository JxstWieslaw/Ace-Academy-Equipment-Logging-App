ABSTRACT

Due to ongoing concerns on how equipment and stocks at sports clubs are managed, it’s been suggested that a system that oversees the flow of all items has to be put in place. This is why the Ace Tennis Academy Head Coach approached AllSoft Solutions for a solution to this issue. The problem was passed down to me and after a few months of development, a desktop application has been tailor-made to their needs. During this report I shall thoroughly go through all the concepts and dependencies that were used to develop the “Ace Academy Equipment Logging System”. 

The project titled “Ace Academy Equipment Logging System” is a sports stock management software for monitoring and controlling the handling of equipment at an academy .The project is developed in Java and mainly focuses on basic operations at an academy like adding new members, new equipment, and updating information, searching equipment and members and facility to borrow and return equipment.  "Ace Academy Equipment Logging System" is a desktop application written for both 32 and 64-bit Windows operating systems, designed to help specific personnel maintain and organize the academy’s equipment. This software is easy to use for both beginners and advanced users.

The system as of now will only contain the administrator’s access and priviledged members who have paid a nominal fee. This is so that there is improved security of the academy’s equipment and giving members’ access as well will open doors to heavy breaches on the system and false issuing and returns. Java was ultimately decided as the primary back-end language with JavaFX used for the front-end as it gives beautiful, modern and styled visuals.  It was an added advantage for me as well as l had to go through numerous learning curves and it improved my coding skills in a period of less than 4 months.
